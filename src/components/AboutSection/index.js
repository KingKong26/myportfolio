            <p>
              My journey began in 2021, coinciding with the pandemic. I started
              exploring different facets of software development during that
              time and found myself increasingly hooked by technology and its
              rapid advancements.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began by learning the fundamentals of software development and
              currently, I am deeply focused on the frontend part of software.
              It excites me to be involved in the process of creating visually
              appealing and highly functional interfaces and experiences for
              users.
            </p>
            <p>
              An essential aspect of my work is my unwavering attention to
              detail and adherence to the design process. It is important to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am excited to continue learning and growing in my career as a
              developer, and I am always looking for new challenges and
              opportunities to expand my skill set.
