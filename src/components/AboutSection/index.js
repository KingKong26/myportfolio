            <p>
              My name is Vishnu Mohanan and I am a college dropout turned full
              stack developer. I started working in my current role in 2021,
              during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic situation actually
              motivated me to become more interested in technology and its
              advancements.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a passion for front end development, as I love the feeling
              of creating visually appealing interfaces and experiences for
              users. I am also interested in UI/UX design, web technologies, and
              mobile app development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am excited to continue learning and growing in my career as a
              developer, and I am always looking for new challenges and
              opportunities to expand my skillset.
